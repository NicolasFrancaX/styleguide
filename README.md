# Magnetis Front-End Styleguide

## Introduction

This repository holds the standards we use on the front-end code of Magnetis.
The idea is to have a common place to look for and to enforce the same code standards throughout team members.

>All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed  
><small>– Rick Waldon</small>

&nbsp;

>Arguments over style are pointless. There should be a style guide, and you should follow it  
><small>– Rebecca Murphey</small>

&nbsp;

>It’s harder to read code than to write it.  
><small>– Joel Spolsky</small>

&nbsp;

>The only thing worse than other people’s code, is your own code 6 months later.  
><small>– Zeh Fernando</small>

&nbsp;

>Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that writing code for yourself is a Bad Idea™. If thousands of people are using your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal preference of how to get clever within the spec.  
><small>– Idan Gazit</small>
